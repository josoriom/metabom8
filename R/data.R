#' 1D NMR specta of Blood Plasma from COVID-19 Patients
#' Samples were collected within the framework of a SARS-CoV 2 research study performed in Perth, Western Australia. FID's were acquired using a standard 90˚ RF pulse sequence on a 600 MHz Avance II spectrometer using Bruker IVDr methods for blood plasms (300 K, 32 scans). The spectrometer was equipped with a double resonance broadban probe (BBI) and a refrigerated autosampler that was operated at 4˚C. Further information on the study setup and NMR pulse sequencuence and FID processing can be found in Kimhofer et al., 'Integrative Modelling of Quantitative Plasma Lipoprotein, Metabolic and Amino Acid Data Reveals a Multi-organ Pathological Signature of SARS-CoV-2 Infection'. Journal of Proteome Research (Aug 2020).
